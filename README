PROSL is a PROSe Linter. It's intended to be a simple way to identify some quality warnings and other statistics about a plaintext prose passage, like repeated words and extremely long sentences. Obviously, there's no accounting for individual style, but the outputs can easily be used to set benchmarks. Set targets for a certain character's lexical density and average sentence length, and then PROSL that character's speech (not possible automatically yet). Get readability indices and so on. 

PROSL is written in Python, on the basis that one day I will write an interactive plugin version of it for Sublime Text (or whatever). Here's hoping.
